TREESET
-------

The underlaying data strucure is BALANCED Tree 

Duplicate Objects are not allowed

Insertion order is not preserved

Heterogeneous objects are not allowed,other wise we will get runtime exception saying class cast exeception

Null insertion is possible (only once)



TreeSet implements seriable,cloneable butnot randomaccess

All objects are inserted based on some sorting order

constructors:
-------------

1) TreeSet ts = new TreeSet()---where the elements will inserted according to Default-natural-sorting order

2)TreeSet ts = new TreeSet(Comparator c);----customized sorting ordercreates an empty treeset object where the elements will inserted to customized sorting order specified by comparator object.

3)TreeSet c = new TreeSet(collection c);

4)TreeSet ts = new TreeSet(SortedSet s);



null acceptance:
----------------

1)t.add(null)

1)for non-empty treeset if we are trying to insert  null then we will get null-pointer exception

2)for empty treeset as  the first element  null is allowed  but after inserting that null ,if we trying to insert any other element we will get run-time exception null-pointer exception 

note:
-----
untill 1.6 version null is allowed as a first element to empty treeset .

form 1.7 version null is not allowed even as the first element (null-such type story not applicable for treeset form 1.7)

ex:2
-----
3) where we use predefined class object in treeset the class should be insert homogeneous object and should implement comparable interface

ex: using new StringBuffer("A") -- RE -CLASS CAST Exception

note:
-----
All wrapper class are comparable (Integer,Long,Double)

String class and all wrapper classes already implement comparable interface but stringbuffer class doesnt implement comparable interface

1)comparable interface (I):abstract method -->FunctionalInterface,marker interface,Interface
--------------------------								static						
it is present in java.lang package and it contains only one method - 

public int compareTo(Object obj)

ob1.compareTo(ob2)

ex:-3

psvm{
sop("A".compareTo("Z"));// -ve
sop("Z".compareTo("K"));//  +ve
sop("A".compareTo("A"));//   0
sop("A".compareTo(null));--RE - nullpointer exception
}
compareTo 
--return -ve if obj1 has to come before obj2
--return +ve if obj1 has to come after obj2
-- return 0 if obj1 & obj2 are equal.


compare 
--return +ve if obj1 has to come before obj2
--return -ve if obj1 has to come after obj2
-- return 0 if obj1 & obj2 are equal.



				-obj.compareTo(obj2)



TreeSet t = new TreeSet();				K  Z
t.add("K"); 
t.add("Z");"Z".compareTo("K") == +ve right node
t.add("A");"A".compareTo("K") == -ve left node
t.add("M");"A".compareTo("K") == -ve		  K
           "M".compareTo("A") == +ve --0   A	M
										        	Z
			"M".compareTo("Z")
Note:
-----
if default natural sorting order is not available or if we are not satified natural sorting order then we can customized sorting by using comparator 


Comparable meant for default natural sorting order where as comparator meant for customized sorting order.




Comparator compare method
